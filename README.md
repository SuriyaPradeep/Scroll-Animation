# Scroll-Animation
The above project sets up a scroll animation trigger by adding an event listener to the scroll event on the window object. When the user scrolls the page, a function will be invoked. This function is likely to contain logic related to checking the positions of certain elements on the page and triggering animations or other actions based on their visibility or position relative to the viewport.
